1. Why are you looking for a job? 
I really want to be in an environment where I can not only bring my diverse skills and adding values to the team but also I want to improve myself both technically and professionally. I researched and heard a lot of good things about your company and I really want to be a part of your team. 

2. What your expectation in terms of salary? 
I would love to know what's your budget would be. 

3. When can you start? 
I can start sooner however out of respect to my current company and team, I would need 2 weeks if you do not mind. I have a good communications and relationship with my manager so that would be least thing i can do for her.
